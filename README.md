Assignment 2: Classification - Customer Churn Prediction Using Classification
Objective:
In this assignment, you will build a classification model to predict customer churn. Churn
prediction is essential for businesses to identify customers at risk of leaving and take action to
retain them.
Dataset:
Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
• Link: Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle
• Description: This dataset contains customer data from a telecommunications company,
including information about services, account status, and whether the customer churned.
It’s one of the most popular datasets for customer churn prediction and works well for
classification problems.
• Features: Customer tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, and churn
label (Yes/No).
Kaggle: Customer Personality Analysis
• Link: Customer Personality Analysis on Kaggle
• Description: This dataset helps classify customers based on various demographics,
purchase behavior, and marketing campaign data. It’s a good fit for a classification task
where you can predict which customers will respond to marketing campaigns or predict
churn based on customer behavior.
• Features: Includes customer attributes like income, education level, marital status,
number of purchases, and complaint counts.
Instructions:
1. Data Preprocessing:
o Load the dataset using Pandas.
o Convert any categorical variables (e.g., ContractType) into numerical values using
one-hot encoding.
o Handle any missing data and scale the features if necessary.
o Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
2. Train a Classification Model:
o Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or
Random Forest).
o Train the model to predict whether a customer will churn (Churn column).
3. Model Evaluation:
o Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
and the confusion matrix.
o Plot a ROC curve and calculate the AUC score to assess model performance.
4. Analysis:
o Write a short analysis explaining how well your model performed. Which features
were most important in predicting churn? Did the model produce any false
positives or false negatives?
Submission:
• Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with your code, comments, and explanations.
• A short report (1-2 pages) discussing model performance, feature importance, and any
recommendations for improving customer retention.
